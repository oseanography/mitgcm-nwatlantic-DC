# mitgcm-nwatlantic

Repository for MITgcm source codes, configuration setups, other necessary scripts, and main outputs for the NW Atlantic simulation.

The circulation model is configured for the NW Atlantic region between Cape Hatteras in the southwest and the Grand Banks in the northeast. Both the Gulf Stream and the Deep Western Boundary Current are present in the simulation. 

The simulation can be run from the initial condition with the source codes, configuration setups, and other necessary scripts (including datasets for the initial conditions). The main output files contain extracted MITgcm outputs from a 2-year long simulation with high vertical resolution. Only the 2nd year (360-730 day) outputs are included. Evolution of eddy kinetic energy in the 2-year simulation suggests that the model reaches a quasi-steady state approx. 3/4 year into the simulation.
